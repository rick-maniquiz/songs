Legendary
by Welshly Arms

Take a look around me
Taking pages from a magazine
Been looking for the answers
Ever since we were seventeen
You know the truth can be a weapon
To fight this world of ill intentions
A new answer to the same question
How many times will you learn the same lesson?
I think they got it all wrong
We just gotta hold on
And on, and on, and on
'Cause we're gonna be legends
Gonna get their attention
What we're doing here ain't just scary
It's about to be legendary
Yeah, we're gonna be legends
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson
Got this feeling in our souls we carry
It's about to be legendary
This is what we came for
And we couldn't want it anymore
We could never turn back now
Got to leave it all on the floor
Been dreaming of the payoff
Through the struggles and the trade-offs
Fighting tooth and nail on the way up
Tell them the truth but they think it's just made up
And I think they got it all wrong
We just gotta hold on
And on, and on, and on
'Cause we're gonna be legends
Gonna get their attention
What we're doing here ain't just scary
It's about to be legendary
Yeah, we're gonna be legends
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson
Got this feeling in our souls we carry
It's about to be legendary
Eventually they're gonna know who's right
To make a stand, you've got to win the fight
Can't stand the heat then just stay out the light
For you might never make it out alive
You gotta live without a compromise
Let everybody hear your battle cry
Yeah, we're gonna be legends
Gonna get their attention
What we're doing here ain't just scary
It's about to be legendary
Yeah, we're gonna be legends
Gonna teach 'em all a lesson
Got this feeling in our souls we carry
It's about to be legendary
Yeah
(Legends) oh, oh
(Legends) ooh, legends
